# Introduction
Serial communication is a common method of transmitting data between a computer
and a peripheral device such as a programmable instrument or even another computer.
Serial communication transmits data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a single
communication line to a receiver. Serial is also a most popular communication protocol
that is used by many devices for instrumentation.[7] This method is used when data
transfer rates are very low or the data must be transferred over long distances and also 
where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties, make parallel communication
impractical. Serial communication is popular because most computers have one or more
serial ports, so no extra hardware is needed other than a cable to connect the instrument
to the computer or two computers together.
Introduction to ATmega328. ATmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. It supports 8-bit data processing. ATmega-328 has 32KB internal flash memory.

# ATmega 328
ATmega328 has 1KB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM). This property shows if the electric supply supplied to the micro-controller is removed, even then it can store the data and can provide results after providing it with the electric supply. Moreover, ATmega-328 has 2KB Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). Other characteristics will be explained later. ATmega 328 has several different features which make it the most popular device in todayâ€™s market. These features consist of advanced RISC architecture, good performance, low power consumption, real timer counter having separate oscillator, 6 PWM pins, programmable Serial USART, programming lock for software security, throughput up to 20 MIPS etc. Further details about ATmega 328 will be given later in this section.
