# Introduction
Serial communication is a common method of transmitting data between a computer
and a peripheral device such as a programmable instrument or even another computer.
Serial communication transmits data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a single
communication line to a receiver. Serial is also a most popular communication protocol
that is used by many devices for instrumentation.[7] This method is used when data
transfer rates are very low or the data must be transferred over long distances and also 
where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties, make parallel communication
impractical. Serial communication is popular because most computers have one or more
serial ports, so no extra hardware is needed other than a cable to connect the instrument
to the computer or two computers together.
